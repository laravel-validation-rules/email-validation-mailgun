# Laravel Validator Rules - Email Validation Mailgun 
Email validation that uses the [Mailgun API](https://documentation.mailgun.com/en/latest/api-email-validation.html#email-validation) for a three-step validation check.  

To find examples of how validation rules can be applied in the Laravel framework, please view the [validation docs](https://laravel.com/docs/5.6/validation).

## Install
Require via composer.
```
composer require kouz/laravel-mailgun-email-validation
```
For Laravel >=5.5 the package will be discoverd. For Laravel <=5.4 add package to list of service providers in config/app.php
```
<?php
  //config/app.php
  
    'providers' => [
        Kouz\LaravelMailgunValidation\ServiceProvider::class,
    ],
```
Publish and fill out the config/mailgun-email-validation.php file with your Mailgun API key.
```
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Kouz\LaravelMailgunValidation\ServiceProvider"
```

## Basic Usage
Use the following rule to validate your email fields. The rule will first check the address against 
PHP's [FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL](http://php.net/manual/en/filter.filters.validate.php) and then will call 
the Mailgun API.

**mailgun_email:role,disposable,mailbox,strict**  
The field under validation must be formatted as an e-mail address. The following flags can be added to
apply additional validation:

* **role** Don't allow role-based addresses.
* **disposable** Don't allow disposable email domains.
* **mailbox** Verify mailbox. Add strict flag to ensure that Mailgun was able to verify a mailbox and didn't return "Unknown".
* **strict** Always require a response from Mailgun to validate. By default if a API request fails, the validation will pass. The strict flag ensures that a Mailgun response was recieved.
